#  LocalPass 2

This project appears to be a password manager app for iOS devices. The project includes several Swift files for various functionalities of the app, such as adding, updating, and deleting password items, PIN authentication for security, and settings. The files use SwiftUI to create views for the app, and there are also extensions for UIColor and Color to convert hex strings to colors. The app also utilizes UserDefaults to save password items locally.
